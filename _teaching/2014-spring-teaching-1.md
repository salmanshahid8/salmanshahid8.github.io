Machine Learning and Optimisation (Autumn Semester - 2023, 2024, 2025)
======

The objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive understanding of **machine learning and optimisation** through practice, primarily in the field of smart energy systems, such as buildings. Following are the contents of this course, adapted mainly for time-series data.
- Read the data from static files or using **REST APIs**
- **Data Engineering** using the [Medallion architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture) on local PCs in **SQLite databases**
- Data Manipulation and **Feature Engineering** of a dataset
- Supervised Learning (**Regression** and **Classification**)
- Unsupervised Learning (**Clustering**)
- Deep Learning (**CNN** and **LSTM** for time-series regression)
- **Natural Language Processing** (Text Cleaning and **Sentiment Analysis**)
- Optimisation Algorithms (**Linear Optimisation, Genetic Optimisation** etc.)
- Use of [OMEGAlpes (Generation of Optimization Models As Linear Programming for Energy Systems)](https://omegalpes.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for energy optimistaion problems

At the end of the module, students are able to:
- Understand the fundamental principles of machine learning algorithms
- Work with real-world data sets (analyze, understand, predict, prescribe) using data science and artificial intelligence tools
- Select and implement **machine learning (or optimisation)** method which is appropriate for the problem under consideration (e.g. time-series prediction, clustering of energy consumption profile, optimisation of battery energy for an energy self-consumption case).
