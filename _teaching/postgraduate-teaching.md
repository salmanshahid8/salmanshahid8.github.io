Machine Learning and Optimisation (Autumn Semester - 2023, 2024, 2025)
=======

[Official Course Link](https://ense3.grenoble-inp.fr/fr/formation/machine-learning-and-optimization-toutes-filieres-m2-sgb-parcours-numerique-weu9mlo5)

The objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive understanding of **machine learning and optimisation** through practice, primarily in the field of smart energy systems, such as buildings. Following are the contents of this course, adapted mainly for time-series data.

- Read the data from static files or using **REST APIs**
- **Data Engineering** using the [Medallion architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture) on local PCs in **SQLite databases**
- Data Manipulation and **Feature Engineering** of a dataset
- Supervised Learning (**Regression** and **Classification**)
- Unsupervised Learning (**Clustering**)
- Deep Learning (**CNN** and **LSTM** for time-series regression)
- **Natural Language Processing** (Text Cleaning and **Sentiment Analysis**)
- Optimisation Algorithms (**Linear Optimisation, Genetic Optimisation** etc.)
- Use of [OMEGAlpes (Generation of Optimization Models As Linear Programming for Energy Systems)](https://omegalpes.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for energy optimistaion problems

At the end of the course, students are able to:

- Understand the fundamental principles of machine learning algorithms
- Work with real-world data sets (analyze, understand, predict, prescribe) using data science and artificial intelligence tools
- Select and implement **machine learning (or optimisation)** method which is appropriate for the problem under consideration (e.g. time-series prediction, clustering of energy consumption profile, optimisation of battery energy for an energy self-consumption case).

Object Oriented Programming in Python (Autumn Semester - 2023)
======

[Official Course Link](https://ense3.grenoble-inp.fr/en/study-at-ense3/computer-sciences-4eus3mon)

The objective of this module is to give a hands-on practice lab to the students for practicing object oriented programming in Python using the provided use-cases. Following are the contents of this course, adapted mainly for time-series data.

- The basic of Python language (Data Types, Collections, Loops)
- Data Manipulation of a dataset using **Pandas** as a dataframe
- **Object Oriented Programming** practice in Python

At the end of the course, students are able to use their knowledge for doing OOP in python.
