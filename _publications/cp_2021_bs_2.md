Abstract
=======
To maintain energy balance in the grid, energy flexibility is entailed at consumer side. Generally, the participants of demand response experiments are offered economic incentive with historic or normative feedback on their energy consumption. In this article, we present an energy flexibility experiment concerning residential sector, which is based on nudge signals with indirect feedback and no monetary incentive. The results show that nudge signal can serve as an important tool to implement energy flexibility without hindering consumer’s comfort. This study is effective to implement energy flexibility on local energy communities while offering no direct economic incentive.
