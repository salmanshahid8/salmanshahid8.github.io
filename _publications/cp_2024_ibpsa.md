Abstract
=======

In the evaluation of advanced building management and control systems, the accuracy and reliability of the building's thermal simulations are very important. They are key to developing and testing new energy management strategies. The study presents the modeling process for the Greener building in Grenoble, including the numerical thermal model creation, and calibration of the numerical model with measured data. The main objective of this study is to accurately simulate the thermal dynamics of the building, allowing the evaluation of efficient energy management and control strategies. The numerical model creation requires the collection and analysis of various types of data, all of which are essential for achieving a realistic and functional model. These data include local weather conditions, thermal properties of the building materials, measured energy consumption profiles, recorded temperature data, etc... To enhance the model's accuracy, a calibration process is undertaken using a tool developed by the CSTB using data collected from a large set of measurement sensors and energy meters in the living lab zone of the Greener building. The calibration tool allows the adjustment of model parameter values through comparison with measured data, ensuring that the model accurately reflects the actual thermal behavior of the building.
