Abstract
=======
The purpose of this article is to introduce two indicators designed to evaluate and consequently influence the indirect emissions related to the operation of an EV. The first indicator, denoted as “Electric Vehicle CarbonFlex Potential” indicator, evaluates an EV's maximum and minimum achievable carbon emissions using an optimization approach and compares the user's resultant indirect carbon emissions to these boundaries, therefore, this indicator compares the users behavior to the optimal best and worst cases. The second indicator is “EcoCharge Time” indicator, which provides feedback to an EV user based on their charging behavior on the best and worst times of charging the vehicle in a day. Since human behavior cannot be controlled, such indicators are essential tools for influencing the behavior of EV users toward a desired optimal, in this case, a charging schedule with the lowest possible overall indirect emissions. The proposed indicators were tested on an EV dataset using the carbon intensity data from a number of countries and the results show that there exists considerable flexibility potential. Additionally, the results also showed the best charging times, which were typically clustered around, allowing for ease of use and understanding.
