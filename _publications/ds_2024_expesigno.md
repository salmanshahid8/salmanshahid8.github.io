Data Card
=======

The main objective of the EXPESIGNO project is to study the electricity consumption behavior of households when faced with load shedding and/or deferral signals. These households participated in an experimental public policy study implemented to manage evening consumption peaks (between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. in winter) and/or solar energy production peaks (between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. in summer).

Two groups of households were formed, one serving as a “control” group and the other representing the ‘treatment’ group, i.e., receiving the “alerts” for load shedding or consumption. Electricity consumption was monitored via consumption readings from Linky meters with the consent of the households.

If you find this dataset useful or have any questions, please feel free to post in the OTE forum thread.

The dataset currently contains data from:

- Presentation slides on the study for both groups: control group (CG) and treatment group (TG)
- A forthcoming scientific article presenting the study and its main findings - The complete study design (in English)
- A presentation of how an “engagement” session (TG) is conducted
- Tables of possible commitments for peak consumption periods and periods of high photovoltaic production
- A CSV file with 30-minute electricity consumption data for the 174 households, from July 18, 2019, to September 28, 2021
- A CSV file with the dates of green and orange alerts
- A CSV file with the electrical equipment owned by households at the start of the study
- A CSV file with the initial daily use of equipment by households
- A CSV file with the initial commitments for the 95 households (orange and green periods)
- A set of xlsx files containing the various variable dictionaries

This dataset covers the period from September 2019 to August 2021. English (2024-11-22)
