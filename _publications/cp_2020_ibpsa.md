Abstract
=======

The energy transition in Europe is leading to decentralized production from intermittent renewable sources. When this changing energy landscape places certain constraints on the energy grid, it requires a high degree of flexibility in energy consumption. Direct flexibility (usually in the form of demand response) is already in place, while the impact of indirect flexibility is not very clear. According to RTE, the residential sector is the largest consumer of energy in France, so it is important for the application of indirect flexibility. In this research, we tested our hypothesis of indirect flexibility using “nudge” signals for a group of households. The impact of the signals is measured by comparing the treated group with the control group and by comparing the consumption load curve with a reference load curve for each household in the treated group. Looking ahead, this study will help network operators minimize congestion through indirect flexibility for the residential sector.
