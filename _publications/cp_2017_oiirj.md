Abstract
=======

Eco-village is a term widely used for such rural areas that utilises indigenous renewable resources for attaining energy self-sufficiency with extremely low GHG emission impact through a closed-loop regenerative system. It is significant for enabling island mode owing to disturbance in national grid, export of excess energy within national grid and ensuring circular economy. In this paper we have considered a small village Luxettipet of Adilabad district in Telangana, India, with the main focus on the economic aspects of possible energy mix. The estimation of generated
electricity is done for renewable resources like solar, biogas, wind and hydro energy, while load of the village is taken into account on the basis of previous annual energy consumption data. The population growth rate is extrapolated by 10%in the next 25 years and the energy consumption has been considered accordingly. Technoeconomic analysis of different possible energy solutions has been performed and is compared with the conventional energy system using HOMER ENERGY software. By performing techno-economic analysis, we observed that the investment and operational costs for different energy resources play a crucial role for electricity pricing. This paper will also lead to future grid planning of Luxettipet and other similar villages to overcome rural electricity crisis.
