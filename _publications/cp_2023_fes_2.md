Abstract
=======
COLLECTiEF (Collective Intelligence for Energy Flexibility) is an EU-funded H2020 project running from June 2021 to May 2025. COLLECTiEF aims to enhance, implement, test, and evaluate an interoperable and saleable energy management system based on collective intelligence that allows easy and seamless integration of legacy equipment into a collaborative network within and between existing buildings and urban energy systems with reduced installation cost, data transfer, and computational power while increasing user comfort, energy flexibility, climate resilience, and data security. To achieve this goal, the COLLECTiEF solution requires the development of software and hardware packages to smart up buildings and their legacy equipment on a large scale while maintaining simple and robust communication with the energy grid. Here, we present the project concept, structure, objectives, and working packages. Furthermore, the main progress and achievements obtained during the first two years of the project are presented.
