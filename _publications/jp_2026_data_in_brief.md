Abstract
=======

Indoor Environmental Quality directly affects public health, productivity, and well-being, while also playing a vital role in developing climate-neutral, energy-efficient, and resilient buildings. This paper presents a comprehensive dataset of indoor environmental parameters that affect thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and visual comfort, which was created under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Project Collective Intelligence for Energy Flexibility. The dataset comprises high-resolution measurements of carbon dioxide, pollutants, volatile organic compounds, air temperature, relative humidity, and illuminance on a horizontal plane, collected over a two-year period at 1-minute intervals. Data were gathered from 14 pilot buildings across four European climates: Cyprus, France, Italy, and Norway, covering diverse building types such as schools, medical centres, sports arenas, residential complexes, universities, and elder care facilities, representing about 40% of common European building categories. Sensors were installed in specific thermal zones within each building to monitor environmental conditions. All data is organized by building and zone and supplemented with standardized Brick metadata to ensure interoperability. This comprehensive dataset, with its broad geographic coverage, variety of building types, long-term high-frequency measurements, and multimodal data, provides a valuable resource for comparative IEQ research, cross-domain modelling, and integrated assessments of comfort, ventilation, and daylighting across different climates and operational settings and is available upon request under a non-disclosure agreement provided by the consortium.
