Abstract
=======

An indirect feedback of energy flexibility is given to the consumer after the period of energy consumption. It is either historic (comparing the energy consumption with the past consumption of the same household), or normative (comparing household energy consumption with that of a group of similar households) (Wang et al. 2018). Graphically, it is presented in the form of clustered baseline load curve of identical households (Abreu, Camara Pereira, and Ferrao 2012) or average load curve of same household (Ozawa, Furusato, and Yoshida 2016). This extended abstract presents a statistical comparison of methods to formulate RLC of residential consumer
